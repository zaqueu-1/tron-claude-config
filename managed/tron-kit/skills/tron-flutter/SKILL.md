description: Flutter and Dart application engineering — null-safe idioms, immutable state (sealed/freezed), widget architecture, BLoC/Riverpod/Provider patterns, GoRouter guards, Dio networking, errors, testing, and review checklists. Use when implementing or reviewing Flutter features, navigation, async UI, or Dart architecture.

Dart and Flutter patterns for production apps: data flow, widgets, routing, HTTP, and quality gates. Platform chrome, adaptive UI, and native feel → **tron-native**; deep accessibility audits → **tron-design** (`audit`, `harden`).

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Null-safe idioms** — Avoid `!`; use `?.`, `??`, early returns, and Dart 3 patterns; reserve `late` for guaranteed init (e.g. `AnimationController` in `initState`).
2. **Explicit async state** — Sealed hierarchies or `freezed` unions for loading/success/failure; no overlapping `isLoading` + `hasError` booleans.
3. **Widget classes, not builders** — Extract `_buildX()` helpers into `StatelessWidget`/`ConsumerWidget` subclasses; push `const` through the tree.
4. **Narrow rebuilds** — Watch providers/blocs only in the smallest subtree; keep static chrome `const`.
5. **Context safety** — After every `await` in widgets, guard with `mounted` / `context.mounted` before navigation, snackbars, or `setState`.
6. **Layer separation** — Widgets render; state containers (Cubit, Notifier, etc.) orchestrate; repositories talk to APIs/DB — inject dependencies, no god objects.
7. **Routing** — One declarative router (typically GoRouter); auth redirects and deep links centralized; typed route args, not raw maps.
8. **HTTP** — Timeouts on the client; auth header interceptor; at most **one** token-refresh retry per request (flag in `extra`).
9. **Lists** — `ListView.builder` / `GridView.builder` (or pagination) for large datasets; no unbounded `children:` lists.
10. **Theming** — Colors and text from `Theme.of(context)`; no scattered magic hex in widgets.
11. **Analysis** — Root `analysis_options.yaml` with strict casts/inference/raw-types; `flutter analyze` clean in CI.
12. **Secrets** — Tokens in platform secure storage; config via `--dart-define` or env excluded from VCS; never log credentials.
13. **Review routing** — Systematic review → **tron-qa** / code-review skill; security pass → **tron-security**; library APIs → **tron-docs** MCP.
