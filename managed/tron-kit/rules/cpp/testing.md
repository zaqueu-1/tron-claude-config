# C++ Testing

> Builds on the shared rules in `../common/testing.md`.

## Stack

GoogleTest + GoogleMock via CMake/CTest.

```bash
cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Coverage

Build with `--coverage`, run ctest, capture with lcov.

## Sanitizers

Address + UB sanitizers in CI test jobs.

Depth: `tron-quality` skill for TDD loop; `tron-cpp` for patterns.
