# PHP Patterns

> Builds on the shared rules in `../common/patterns.md`.

## Controllers

HTTP concerns only — auth, validation, status, serialization.

## Services

Business rules in injectable services testable without bootstrapping the full framework.

## DTOs / values

Typed request/response objects; value objects for money, ids, ranges.

## Boundaries

Thin ORM models; adapter wrappers around third-party SDKs.

API shape: `tron-services` skill; Laravel architecture: `tron-php` skill.
