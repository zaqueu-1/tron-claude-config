# Web testing

Priority: visual regression at key breakpoints → a11y (keyboard, contrast, reduced motion) → Lighthouse/CWV → cross-browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari) → responsive widths.

Playwright for E2E/visual; unit tests for utilities/hooks. Deterministic waits, not arbitrary sleeps.

**tron-quality** skill for broader QA patterns.
