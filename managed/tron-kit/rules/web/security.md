# Web security

Production CSP with nonces for scripts where possible; tighten per project. No unsanitized HTML (`innerHTML` / framework escape hatches) without sanitizer.

Third-party scripts: async, SRI on CDNs, periodic audit. Security headers: HSTS, `nosniff`, frame deny, referrer policy, permissions policy.

Forms: CSRF on mutations; server validation; rate limits.

**tron-security** for deep review.
