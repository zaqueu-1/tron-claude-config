# Web design quality

Avoid generic template UI. Before coding: pick a deliberate direction (not vague "clean minimal"); define palette and type; gather references; use **tron-design** (`audit`, `harden`) for a11y/finish.

Ship hierarchy, rhythm, states (hover/focus/active), and intentional light/dark when both exist. Skip stock hero + gradient blob defaults and uniform card grids with no POV.

Checklist: not a default component-library clone; believable in a product screenshot; meaningful interaction states.
