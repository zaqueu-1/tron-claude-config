# Angular harness hooks

PostToolUse on TS/HTML edits:

- Prettier on touched files
- `ng lint` (or eslint angular config)
- `tsc --noEmit` for quick type feedback
- `ng build` after codegen-sized changes (templates + types)

Stop hook: lint sweep on modified paths.

Tune aggressiveness with `TRON_HOOK_PROFILE` and disable specific ids via `TRON_DISABLED_HOOKS`.
