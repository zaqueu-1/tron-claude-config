# @tron/claude-config

Drop one dependency into any repo. On `npm install`, Claude Code gets **hooks, git gates, scoped coding rules, and the official skills** (`/commit-changes`, `/code-review`, `/security-review`, `/make-pr`) — enforced by the filesystem, not by memory.

> **Hooks over vibes.** Reviews before commits. Complete PRs before merge. Rules matched to the project stack. Silent daily self-update.

---

## Why you should install this

| Without the harness | With the harness |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Anyone (or any model) can `git commit` raw | Only `/commit-changes` after **security + code review** |
| PRs that say “fix stuff” | Template with **5 mandatory sections** (PT-BR) |
| Rules copied by hand (or forgotten) | **ECC rules scoped** to Vue / React / TS / … automatically |
| “Did you update the package?” | **Auto-update** once per day, silent |
| Different process per repo | **One kit** across the company |
| Verbose AI replies | **Caveman** always on — same substance, fewer tokens |

## 60-second install

### 1. Add the dependency

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tron/claude-config": "git+https://github.com/zaqueu-1/tron-claude-config.git"
  }
}
```

### 2. Install

```bash
npm install   # or: bun install / pnpm install
```

That’s it. `postinstall` wires the repo and (on developer machines) installs the global skills.

> Works with **npm, bun, and pnpm** — detected from your lockfile.

The harness lives under `.claude/` and `.git/hooks/`. It does **not** overwrite your `CLAUDE.md`, repo-local `.claude/commands/`, or `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### On the developer machine (install-if-missing)

| Command | Role |
|---------|------|
| `/commit-changes` | Official commit path — reviews → token → commit → push |
| `/code-review` | Quality / correctness gate (**required** before commit) |
| `/security-review` | Security checklist gate (**required** before commit) |
| `/make-pr` | Official PR path — PT-BR template + token |

Also installed:

- Karpathy guidelines skill + always-on rules under `~/.claude/rules/`
- **Emil Kowalski** + **Impeccable** + **Taste** skills (primary DESIGN authority) + **ui-ux-pro-max** (subordinate) + **frontend-design** (supporting guardrail) — mandatory on any UI task; see `AGENTS.md`
- **session-handoff** skill (install-if-missing) — writes the session context as an actionable note in a central Obsidian vault (one folder per repo, never inside a repository) and reads it back to resume; the vault path lives in `~/.claude/skills/session-handoff/config.json`, asked once on first use
- **issue-board** skill (always synced) — shows the open issues of any GitHub Project (v2) as terminal tables, split by type, priority, difficulty, status or a board field; the agent classifies what the board leaves empty. `render.py` draws the tables with Python `rich` when it is installed and falls back to the plain Node render otherwise. Requires `gh auth login -s read:project`. The board lives in `~/.claude/skills/issue-board/config.json`, asked once on first use, and is never overwritten
- **Caveman** (`caveman.md`): terse replies enforced every session ([JuliusBrussee/caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman)) — always overwritten from the package
- **codebase-memory-mcp** ([DeusData](https://github.com/DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp)): required MCP for graph-first codebase navigation — install is **guaranteed** on macOS, Linux, and Windows (`install.sh` / `install.ps1` + `Unblock-File`, retries, npm fallback). `postinstall` exits `1` if registration in `~/.claude/.mcp.json` still fails
- **doc** skill (always synced) — `/doc` finds the repo's Obsidian documentation vault (any folder with `.obsidian/`), reads the latest session note or the current conversation, flags notes whose `file:line` references broke or point to changed code, and applies only the doc changes the user approves (never commits). No vault: warns and offers a minimal one. Works in any project

Existing customized commands are **never overwritten**.

### Frontend design skills — MAX DESIGN authority

On any frontend/UI task the harness enforces a single design stack, in strict priority order:

1. **Emil Kowalski + Impeccable + Taste** — the **maximum source of truth for design**. Emil covers interaction and animation craft (`emil-design-eng`, `animate`, `mobile-native`, …), Impeccable sets design direction, the quality bar, and hook-enforced edit discipline, and Taste (`design-taste-frontend` + variants) drives high-end visual, landing, and redesign direction.
2. **ui-ux-pro-max** — important but **subordinate**: run its design-system generator *after* the combo sets direction, then apply its stack CSVs, UX guidance, and pre-delivery checklist.
3. **frontend-design** — optional supporting guardrail (anti-generic-AI look only).

**On any conflict, the Emil + Impeccable + Taste combo always wins over ui-ux-pro-max and frontend-design.** Agents announce `Using Emil + Impeccable + Taste (+ ui-ux-pro-max) for [purpose]`. Full contract: [AGENTS.md](managed/AGENTS.md).

Where they land on the developer machine:

- **Emil** and **Taste** are vendored under `managed/skills/{emilkowalski,leonxlnx}/`, installed to `~/.agents/skills/`, then symlinked into `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.cursor/skills/`.
- **Impeccable** is vendored under `managed/skills/impeccable/` and copied to `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, **and** `~/.github/skills/impeccable/`. Its `impeccable-*` subagents copy to `~/.claude/agents/` + `~/.cursor/agents/`, and edit-discipline hooks are written into the consumer repo's `.cursor/hooks.json` and `.github/hooks/impeccable.json`. The `darwin-arm64` engine binary ships in-tree; other platforms fetch the pinned, checksum-verified binary on first run and cache it under `~/.impeccable/`.
- **ui-ux-pro-max** and **frontend-design** install (if missing) under `~/.claude/skills/`.
- The `frontend-skills.mdc` rule (always synced to `~/.cursor/rules/`) encodes this authority order for every UI task.

## How enforcement works

### Commit path

1. `/security-review` on the staged/branch diff → **BLOCK** on CRITICAL/HIGH  
2. `/code-review` on the same diff → **BLOCK** on CRITICAL/HIGH  
3. Create `.claude/.commit-authorized`  
4. `git commit` — hooks allow once, then delete the token  

Raw `git commit` in the terminal? **Blocked** by `pre-commit`.

### PR path

1. `/make-pr` writes `.claude/.pr-body-draft.md` from `.claude/PR-TEMPLATE.md` (5 PT-BR sections)
2. Runs `node .claude/hooks/lib/validate-pr-body.cjs .claude/.pr-body-draft.md`
3. Creates `.claude/.pr-authorized`
4. `gh pr create --body-file .claude/.pr-body-draft.md` — hook validates token, **command**, and headers (blocks inline `--body` and English `## Summary`)

Required sections: **Resumo**, **Principais mudanças**, **Arquitetura & implementação**, **Antes → Agora**, **Roteiro de teste**.  
English headers (`Summary`, `Test plan`, …) are **rejected**. If a section doesn’t apply, keep the header and use `_N/A — não aplicável a esta mudança_`.

### Scoped ECC rules

On install and on harness setup/update, the package:

1. Detects stack from `package.json` + project markers  
2. Clones [ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) temporarily  
3. Syncs **only** matching folders into `.claude/rules/ecc/`  
4. Removes managed folders that no longer match  

Always: `common`. Conditionally: `typescript`, `vue`, `nuxt`, `react`, `react-native`, `web`, `csharp`, `python`, `golang`, and other ECC languages when detected.

### Session bootstrap

Every Claude prompt runs `bootstrap-check.sh`:

- Re-runs `ensure-codebase-memory.js` if the MCP is missing (same Win + Unix path as postinstall)
- Warns if `gsd` is missing  
- Once per 24h, compares package SHA to remote and self-updates  

Manual repair: `npm run ensure:codebase-memory` (or `node node_modules/@tron/claude-config/scripts/lib/ensure-codebase-memory.js`).

## Quality layers

| Layer | Where | Wins on |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **ECC rules** | `.claude/rules/ecc/` | Coding standards |
| **Karpathy principles** | `~/.claude/rules/harness-enforcement.md` | Behavior: simplicity, surgical edits |
| **Harness skills** | `~/.claude/commands/*` | Commit / PR workflow |

ECC > Karpathy on standards. Karpathy > ECC on how to approach the work.

## Emergency bypass

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency only"
git push --no-verify

# Tear down gates in one repo:
rm .git/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-push
```

---

## Keep it fresh

Push to `main` in this repo. Consumers pick up changes on the next daily check — or immediately on `npm install`.

```bash
npm version patch|minor|major
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

## Uninstall

```bash
rm .git/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-push
