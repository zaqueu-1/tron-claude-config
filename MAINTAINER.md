# tron-claude-config — Maintainer Guide

Owner playbook for the shared Claude enforcement harness (`@tron/claude-config` **v1.11.0**).

## What this package does

On consumer `npm install` / `bun install` / `pnpm install`, `scripts/postinstall.js`:

1. Copies managed Claude settings + hooks into `.claude/`
2. Copies `AGENTS.md` and `scripts/setup-claude-harness.sh`
3. Installs git `pre-commit` / `pre-push` hooks (via `git rev-parse --git-path hooks`, respects `core.hooksPath`)
4. Syncs **scoped** tron-kit rules into `.claude/rules/tron/` from the bundled snapshot (detect stack → copy matching folders → prune stale ones; no network)
5. On developer machines (not CI): installs the `tron-kit@tron` Claude plugin (see [Syncing tron-kit from upstream](#syncing-tron-kit-from-upstream)) and removes the legacy upstream plugin, its marketplace and user-level rules; installs the 12 tron agents + roster guard hooks (`scripts/lib/install-tron-agents.js`); the workflow engine with the `standard` profile for Claude Code and Cursor; install-if-missing skills; always-overwritten core rules (`terse.md`, `engineering-principles.md`, removing their retired predecessors); **attempt** `tron-graph` via `scripts/lib/ensure-tron-graph.js` (retries + npm fallback on Windows/WSL; renames the engine's own MCP keys to `tron-graph`; warns instead of aborting postinstall if still missing) and registers `tron-docs` via `scripts/lib/ensure-tron-docs.js`
6. On developer machines (not CI): installs the **frontend design skill harness** — the **tron design stack** (`tron-design`, `tron-motion`, `tron-native`, `tron-imagery` — maximum DESIGN source of truth), with **tron-design-fallback** subordinate (charts, forms, web navigation, stack guidelines); removes leftover `ui-ux-pro-max` / `frontend-design` and retired design skill folders and disables the `frontend-design@claude-plugins-official` plugin (see [Frontend design skills](#frontend-design-skills-max-design-authority))
7. Thereafter, `bootstrap-check.sh` self-updates the package about once per day

Non-technical users get gates without extra setup. Engineers get them on install.

---

## Frontend design skills (MAX DESIGN authority)

The harness ships a full frontend design stack, vendored in-repo and installed on developer machines. Authority order (enforced by `managed/AGENTS.md` and `managed/cursor/rules/frontend-skills.mdc`):

1. **tron design stack** — `tron-design` (always first), `tron-motion`, `tron-native`, `tron-imagery` — the **maximum source of truth for DESIGN**.
2. **tron-design-fallback** — **subordinate**; consulted only after the stack sets direction, and only for charts/data viz, form UX, web navigation patterns and stack guidelines (Vue, Nuxt, React, Next.js, React Native, shadcn/ui, Tailwind).

**On conflict, the tron design stack always wins.** Do not weaken this rule when editing skill docs. Agents announce `Using tron-design for [purpose]`, naming each companion skill actually loaded.

The former ui-ux-pro-max and frontend-design layer was removed: its direction-setting data competed with the stack and the rest was already covered. Only the missing pieces were extracted into `tron-design-fallback` (attribution line kept in its `SKILL.md`). Do not re-add a second direction-setting layer.

| Skill set | Vendored under | Install behavior |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| tron design stack | `managed/skills/tron-{design,motion,native,imagery}/` (+ `managed/hooks/{cursor,github}/`) | `installTronDesignStack()` syncs each skill fresh into `~/.agents/skills/<name>/` + symlinks into `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, `~/.github/skills/` (copy fallback). `installTronDesignHooks()` merges the detector hook into consumer `.cursor/hooks.json` + `.github/hooks/tron-design.json`, keeping existing hooks and migrating the legacy launcher path. The engine runs only through `tron-design/scripts/tron-design` (telemetry and self-update off, agent-facing output rebranded); the `darwin-arm64` binary is vendored under `scripts/bin/`, other platforms download the pinned binary on first run |
| tron-design-fallback | `managed/skills/tron-design-fallback/` (`SKILL.md` + `references/stacks/*.md`) | `installTronDesignFallback()` → `~/.claude/skills/tron-design-fallback/` + `~/.cursor/skills/tron-design-fallback/` (always synced, overwritten) |
| Legacy design cleanup | — | `removeLegacyDesignSkills()` deletes `ui-ux-pro-max`, `frontend-design` and the 27 retired design skill names from `~/.{claude,cursor,agents,github}/skills/` (symlinks unlinked, not followed) and calls `disablePlugin('frontend-design@claude-plugins-official')` from `scripts/lib/install-tron-kit.js` (`claude plugin disable --scope <scope>` when installed + enabled; settings.json `enabledPlugins[...] = false` fallback) |
| frontend-skills rule | `managed/cursor/rules/frontend-skills.mdc` | `installFrontendSkillsRule()` → `~/.cursor/rules/frontend-skills.mdc` (always synced) |

To add or update a design skill, edit the source under `managed/skills/{tron-design,tron-motion,tron-native,tron-imagery,tron-design-fallback}/`, keep the install function in `postinstall.js` in sync, and bump the version (`minor` for a new skill). The stack references in `tron-design-fallback/references/stacks/` are hand-maintained (High-severity rules only); keep them terse.

## Official skill contract

`/commit-changes` order is fixed:

1. `/security-review` — BLOCK on CRITICAL/HIGH  
2. `/code-review` — BLOCK on CRITICAL/HIGH  
3. `touch .claude/.commit-authorized`  
4. `git commit` (hook consumes token)  
5. Push (pre-push accepts commit or PR token)

When editing `managed/skills/commit-changes/SKILL.md`, keep that order. When editing PR section headers, keep them in sync with `bypass-check.sh`.

---

## Releasing a new version

```bash
# 1. Change files under managed/ or scripts/
# 2. Bump semver
npm version patch   # or minor | major

# 3. Commit + push
git push origin main
git push --tags
```

Consumers pick up the release on the next daily bootstrap check, or immediately on `npm install`.

---

## How auto-update works (consumer)

`UserPromptSubmit` → `bootstrap-check.sh`:

1. Skip if `.claude/.harness-last-update` is less than 24h old  
2. Compare installed git SHA / version to remote  
3. If outdated: package-manager install of `@tron/claude-config`, then `setup-claude-harness.sh --silent` (hooks + **tron-kit rules re-sync**)  
4. Refresh the timestamp  

Silent by design. At most one status line in the session.

---

## Adding a new managed hook

1. Add `managed/claude/hooks/your-hook.sh`  
2. Register copy in `scripts/postinstall.js` (`MANAGED_FILES`)  
3. Wire in `managed/claude/settings.json`  
4. Test with `DRY=1` in a consumer  
5. Bump version + push  

## Adding a new git hook

1. Add executable under `managed/git-hooks/`  
2. Register in `GIT_HOOKS` inside `postinstall.js`  
3. Release  

## Adding a new global skill (install-if-missing)

1. Add `managed/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`  
2. Add `installXSkill()` in `postinstall.js` (copy to `~/.claude/commands/<name>.md` only if missing)  
3. Call it inside the `if (!IS_CI)` block  
4. Document in README + HARNESS-GUIDE + this table  
5. `npm version minor` + push  

## Changing tron-kit scope detection

1. Edit `scripts/lib/detect-project-scope.js`  
2. Dry-run: `node scripts/sync-tron-rules.js /path/to/consumer --dry-run`  
3. Confirm prune behavior for folders that leave scope  
4. Patch/minor bump as appropriate  

---

## Syncing tron-kit from upstream

`managed/tron-kit/` is a **frozen snapshot** of the MIT-licensed upstream [affaan-m/ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) Claude plugin (formerly installed as `ecc@ecc`), renamed and owned by this package. Consumers never fetch upstream: postinstall copies the snapshot to `~/.claude/tron-kit/`, stamps `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + the `marketplace.json` entry with this package's `version` (so `claude plugin update` sees each release), and installs `tron-kit@tron` at user scope. The upstream `LICENSE` stays in the snapshot for attribution.

Refresh the snapshot (maintainers only, needs network):

```bash
npm run sync:tron-kit                      # re-pull the pinned ref (upstream/sources.json, id tron-kit)
npm run sync:tron-kit -- --dry-run         # fetch + apply rules in a tmp dir, print counts, touch nothing
npm run sync:tron-kit -- --latest          # take upstream HEAD and write the new sha into sources.json
npm run sync:tron-kit -- --ref <sha|branch> # sync a specific ref (resolved sha written into sources.json)
```

Repo and pin live in `upstream/sources.json` (id `tron-kit`); everything else the sync does is driven by `upstream/tron-kit.config.json`:

- `include` — top-level upstream paths copied. Upstream `agents/` is not included: the 12 tron agents (`managed/agents/`) own the roster
- `allow` — allowlists for `skills` and `commands`; everything else upstream stays out, including new upstream additions. Kept: technical skills that back a tron agent. Dropped: workflow commands/skills GSD already owns (plan, prp, orch, multi, epic, sessions, loops, learning), duplicates of tron skills (`code-review`, `security-review`, `pr`, `save-session`), the design/motion/a11y skills that compete with the tron design stack, and non-engineering domains. A listed name missing upstream aborts the sync
- `exclude` — globs never brought back (stale hook docs, junk files)
- `hooks.keep` / `hooks.derive` — only these hooks survive: `pre:bash:block-no-verify` (derived from the config-protection entry, so it runs without the upstream bash dispatcher), `pre:config-protection`, `post:edit:accumulate`, `stop-format-typecheck`, `check-console-log`. Telemetry, learning, compaction and session hooks are dropped (GSD covers context and sessions)
- `prune` — directories (`scripts`, `config`, `schemas`, `manifests`, `mcp-configs`) reduced to files reachable from kept hooks, skills, commands and rules
- `rewrites` — literal find/replace applied after copy. They retarget the hook/command root resolvers from the upstream plugin slugs to `tron-kit` / `tron-kit@tron` / `marketplaces/tron` / cache dir `tron`, and swap `/save-session` mentions for `/session-handoff`. Each rewrite asserts `minMatches`; the sync aborts with a clear error if upstream drifted — fix the rule, never loosen it blindly
- `hooks.stripMatcherKeys` — keys removed from `hooks/hooks.json` matcher entries (matches how the plugin was installed before the migration)
- `plugin` / `marketplace` — metadata for the generated `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`

The sync also writes `upstream/state/tron-kit.json` (repo, resolved sha, upstream version, timestamp, excluded paths, rewrite counts). After a sync: review the diff, run `claude plugin validate managed/tron-kit`, then release with a `minor` bump.

---

## Upstream ownership

Everything this package ships is a **tron interpretation** of an upstream. Shipped content never names or links upstreams; provenance lives only in `upstream/` (excluded from the npm package by the `files` allowlist, together with this file and the maintainer scripts).

- `upstream/sources.json` — one entry per upstream: `repo`, pinned `ref`, `license`, `kind` (content / runtime), `status` (vendored → rewritten; runtime: wrapped → replaced), `phase`, the tron artifact it feeds, `watch` (paths we consume; `map` pairs upstream dirs to renamed tron skills) and `discover` (dirs where new upstream items appear).
- `npm run upstream:watch [-- <id>...]` — mirrors each repo (blobless, cached in `upstream/.cache/`), diffs pinned → upstream HEAD restricted to the watched paths, lists commits touching them and new upstream items not adopted, and writes `upstream/reports/<date>-<id>.md`. Sources with nothing relevant just report "nothing relevant".
- Porting: read the report, **re-express** relevant changes in the tron artifact in our own words (no verbatim copies), then `npm run upstream:watch -- --accept <id> [--ref <sha>]` to move the pin. `tron-kit` moves only via `npm run sync:tron-kit`.
- `npm run upstream:originality [-- <id>...]` — the ownership gate. For each source with an `originality` block it compares the tron files' prose (code stripped) against the upstream files at the pin using 8-word runs, and scans them for upstream names (`brandTerms`); engine-owned literals (`.impeccable/` state paths, `IMPECCABLE_*` env names) are exempt. Exit 1 on any hit — run it after every port and before every release.
- Runtime tools are wrapped behind tron names until replaced: code graph → `tron-graph`, docs → `tron-docs` (MCP keys renamed on install), design engine → `tron-design/scripts/tron-design` (the engine's own launcher and binary stay untouched next to it; the wrapper refuses `update`/`install`, disables telemetry and rebrands agent-facing output).
- Licenses: MIT / Apache-2.0 notices stay with still-vendored code (`managed/tron-kit/LICENSE`; the wrapped design engine ships `scripts/ENGINE-LICENSE`) until it is rewritten or replaced; a rewritten artifact carries no upstream text, so no notice is needed.

Ownership phases: 1) foundation — tracker, provenance, wrappers, core rules (done); 2) design stack → tron-design (done: content rewritten, engine wrapped); 3) tron-kit skills and hooks rewritten; 4) tron-flow replaces the workflow engine.

Integration checklist in a throwaway clone:

- [ ] `.claude/settings.json` + both hooks present  
- [ ] `.git/hooks/pre-commit` / `pre-push` executable  
- [ ] `.claude/rules/tron/common` exists; stack folders match the app  
- [ ] `claude plugin list` shows `tron-kit@tron` enabled and no legacy upstream plugin  
- [ ] `~/.claude/commands/{commit-changes,code-review,security-review,make-pr}.md` present (or intentionally left as pre-existing customs)  
- [ ] Raw `git commit` blocked; token path works  
- [ ] `~/.claude/.mcp.json` has a `tron-graph` server (or CI skipped machine installs)  
- [ ] `~/.claude/rules/{terse,engineering-principles}.md` present after install

## quanthubbr mirror sync

[quanthubbr/tron-claude-config](https://github.com/quanthubbr/tron-claude-config) is an **org mirror** of this repo — not a GitHub fork, so there is no upstream PR button.

**Canonical repo:** `zaqueu-1/tron-claude-config` (development + releases)  
**Mirror repo:** `quanthubbr/tron-claude-config` (quanthub consumer repos install from here)

### Automatic sync (GitHub Actions — on the **mirror** repo)

Workflow `.github/workflows/sync-from-upstream.yml` is committed here but **runs only on** `quanthubbr/tron-claude-config`. On the canonical repo the job is always skipped.

After the workflow file is on the mirror `main` branch:

1. **quanthubbr/tron-claude-config → Actions** — enable workflows if prompted  
2. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** (optional):
   - `UPSTREAM_TOKEN` — only if `zaqueu-1/tron-claude-config` is private (read access)  
   - If public, no secret needed — `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes on the mirror
3. Run **Sync from upstream** manually once, or wait for the daily schedule (06:00 UTC)

The workflow fast-forwards `main` and pushes tags from the canonical repo. It fails if the mirror diverged — resolve before re-running.

### Manual push (only with git push access to mirror)

```bash
git remote add quanthub https://github.com/quanthubbr/tron-claude-config.git  # once
git checkout main && git pull origin main
npm run sync:quanthub
```

Dry-run: `bash scripts/sync-quanthub-fork.sh --check`

### Pull mirror-only commits → canonical (rare)

```bash
bash scripts/sync-quanthub-fork.sh --pull
git push origin main
```

### quanthub consumer `package.json`

```json
"@tron/claude-config": "git+https://github.com/quanthubbr/tron-claude-config.git"
```

Pin versions with tags: `#v1.7.0`

---

## Rollback

```bash
git revert HEAD
npm version patch
git push && git push --tags
```

Pin a consumer in an emergency:

```json
"@tron/claude-config": "git+https://github.com/zaqueu-1/tron-claude-config.git#v1.7.0"
```

---

## Versioning scheme

| Change type | Bump | Examples |
|-------------|------|----------|
| Bug fix in hook/script | `patch` | Shell syntax, false-positive scope |
| New hook, skill, or enforcement | `minor` | New review skill, new tron-kit scope detector |
| Breaking rename/removal | `major` | Rename managed path consumers rely on |

Prefer a `CHANGELOG.md` for humans debugging auto-update surprises.

---

## Consumer onboarding (new repo)

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@tron/claude-config": "git+https://github.com/zaqueu-1/tron-claude-config.git"
}
```

```bash
npm install
```

No further manual steps. Skills install on developer machines; CI skips machine-level tooling.
